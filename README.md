# Minesweeper recreation project in Löve framework

A simple recreation of the original Minesweeper game to practice Löve and Lua.

You left-click to discover the minecube and you right-click to put a flag.

A timer and the number of remaining mines are shown at the top of the screen.

You can reset with "r" and close the game with "esc".

You have to find 30 mines out of 176.

### ⚠️ This is very bad optimized code because it's my first project and I don't know how to optimize Lua or Löve ! If you have suggestions or any advices, let me know !
